# Introduction

Hello World, this is my very first website created using [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Thanks to my new friends, I can now show to the wolrd [my agent-based modelling project](https://github.com/sgvionet/Leeds-GEOG5995) which I have worked on for the past month as part of my doctoral training. If you want to find out more about who I am and what I do, [click here](https://sgvionet.github.io/index2.html).

But first, a little bit about __*wine*__. Why wine? Well, basically the theme for this webpage is called **Merlot**, which is named after [a very popular dark blue wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot). 

Make sure you enjoy the model I created as you would relish a glass of refined merlot! I'll leave you the following quote below as guideline.

> He who knows how to taste does not drink wine but savours secrets. 
                              - Salvador Dal√¨.
