# Introduction

Hello World, this is my very first website created using [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Thanks to my new friends, I can now show to the wolrd my [agent-based modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) project which I have worked on for the past month. 

But first, a little bit about __*wine*__. Why wine? Well, basically the theme for this webpage is called **Merlot**, which is named after [a very popular dark blue wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot). 

Make sure you enjoy the model I created as you would relish a glass of refined merlot! I'll leave you the following quote below as guideline.

> He who knows how to taste does not drink wine but savours secrets. 
                              - Salvador Dal√¨.
