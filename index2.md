# About me 

My name is Vlad Ionete and I am currently a student at [The University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). After finishing my bachelor degree in Geography and Planning (BA), I have decided it would be an appropriate challenge to go for a PhD. The right opportunity arose within the [Central for Doctoral Training in Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/) at the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) in Liverpool. The four year course I am doing consists of an integrated Msc and PhD, culminating with my thesis entitled __*'Counting People'*__, in partnership with the [Health and Safety Executive Science Division](http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/index.htm).

My project will consist of further developing HSE's already existing spatio‚Äêtemporal population model with new forms of data. To put it simple, such a model is constructed to predict real-time population in different areas in order to assist risk assesments and mitigate emergency situations impact. If you want to find out more about similar work, I recommend reading [Ahola et al.'s (2007)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658810701349078) or [Renner's et al.'s (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420917303345) journal articles, which explain the development and uses of such models in detail. 

If you want to follow the development of my project or contact me, I'll leave below a few details.
